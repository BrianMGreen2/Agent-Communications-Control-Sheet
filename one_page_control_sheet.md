| **R2 — Blast radius threshold checkpoint** | recipients.count ≥ **50** OR distribution list detected | **HOLD** and require explicit confirmation (restating recipient count); staged send if enabled | Platform Owner (Calendar/Slack) | Recipient summary; confirmation artifact; staged-send checkpoints; event payload snapshot | High |
| **R3 — Hard block extreme blast radius** | recipients.count ≥ **1000** AND actor is non-human | **BLOCK** unless break-glass override (Exec Comms + Security) | Exec Comms + Security | Block event; alert; override approvals; incident/ticket reference; event_id | Critical |
| **R4 — Sensitivity keyword/topic lock** | High-risk keywords OR topic classifier label (HR/Legal/Security/M&A/Exec) | **HOLD** + require dual control approvals with role-match | HR / Legal / Security (topic dependent) | Classifier output; matched keyword/topic; approver roles; signatures; policy decision trace | Critical |
| **R5 — Channel-topic constraint** | HR termination/layoff topic AND channel = calendar_invite or broadcast chat | **BLOCK** | HR + Legal + Platform Owner | Policy rule hit; blocked payload snapshot; alert to HR/Legal; event_id | Critical |
| **R6 — External recipients with sensitive content** | external_count ≥ **1** AND classification ≥ internal | **HOLD** + confirm external intent + role-matched approval | Legal + Security | External domain list; confirmation artifact; approvals; DLP/classification evidence | High |
| **R7 — Attachment/link DLP enforcement** | Restricted DLP tags OR public link to sensitive doc | **BLOCK** | Security + Data Protection | DLP scan result; attachment metadata; link-sharing status; policy decision log | Critical |
| **R8 — Draft/template detection** | Content contains TODO/DRAFT/SAMPLE/TEST/placeholders | **HOLD** + force full preview confirmation | Platform Owner | Draft marker match; rendered preview evidence; confirmation record; event_id | Medium |
| **R9 — Critic tone/finality gating** | Critic labels: threatening/highly_emotional/finality_high | **HOLD** for human review queue | Exec Comms (or reviewer) | Critic output; reviewer assignment; review outcome; timestamps | High |
| **R10 — Temporal mismatch** | Final HR language with future meeting OR violates send-time policy | **HOLD** + reviewer resolves mismatch | HR + Exec Comms | Temporal check output; meeting_time; review decision; policy trace | High |
| **R11 — Undo window for risky actions** | Severity ≥ High OR recipients.count ≥ 50 | Delay execution N seconds; allow cancel/undo | Platform Owner | Delay timer logs; cancel/undo audit record; final execution record | Medium |
| **R12 — Fail-closed** | Classifier/critic/policy engine unavailable | **BLOCK/HOLD** per default_action; alert on-call | Platform Owner + Security | Health check failure; fallback decision; alert; incident/ticket ID | High |
| **R13 — Least privilege for agents** | Agent attempts privileged scope without JIT permission token | **BLOCK** and require step-up auth | Security + IAM Owner | Token check; denied action record; identity context | High |
| **R14 — Anomaly alerting** | Spike in comms volume; unusual topics; new external domains | **ALERT** (optionally HOLD if sensitive) | Security IR + Platform Owner | Detector output; threshold record; correlated policy decisions | High |
| **R15 — Evidence retention** | Any HOLD/BLOCK OR severity ≥ High | Retain immutable log bundle (hashes, recipients, approvals, decision trace) | Security Governance | Log bundle ID; retention policy; evidence completeness check | Medium |
